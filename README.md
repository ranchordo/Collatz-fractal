# Collatz-fractal
Weird self-similarities and patterns are found when expanding the Collatz conjecture to the complex plane. This repo contains code for generating this fractal.
This code requires [Lepton-gl](https://github.com/ranchordo/lepton/tree/lepton-gl) to build correctly. This is used for deploying the compute shader.
The resources folder needs to be added to the build path for Lepton to recognize the compute shaders. This option in Eclipse is "Use as source folder".
